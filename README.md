In this project, the objective was to visualize and explore the effectiveness of KickStarter campaigns using tools in Excel, specifically if statements and pivot tables.

In the tab, 'Main Table', the goal was to clean the data and visualize trends using conditional formatting. Once this data was cleaned, trends started to emerge and the pivot tables were ready to be constructed.

The Category & Subcategory pivot tables illustrate the success rates of campaigns based on their designated category and subcategory, respectively.

The Data pivot table categorizes each campaign based on which month the campaign was launched. 

The Goal pivot table categorizes each campaign based on each campaign's $ goal.
