In this project, the objective was to visualize and explore the effectiveness of Kickstarter campaigns using tools in Excel, specifically if statements and pivot tables.

In the tab, 'Main Table', the goal was to clean the data and visualize trends using conditional formatting. Once this data was cleaned, trends started to emerge and the pivot tables were ready to be constructed.

The Category & Subcategory pivot tables illustrate the success rates of campaigns based on their designated category and subcategory, respectively.

The Data pivot table categorizes each campaign based on which month the campaign was launched. 

The Goal pivot table categorizes each campaign based on each campaign's $ goal.

The following represents findings based on these visuals:

When observing “status” comparisons by parent category, it becomes apparent that over a third (34%) of all Kickstarter campaigns and nearly 40% of all “successful” campaigns are categorized as “theater.”  By these measures, it can initially be argued that theater is the most popular campaign. However, this data also suggests that “music” campaigns are arguably more successful in terms of greater successful percentages and lower failed percentages.  Only 17% of music campaigns failed (compared to 35% for theater) and 77% of music campaigns were successful (compared to 60% for theater). In a Kickstarter environment where 37% of all campaigns fail, a music campaign appears to the positioned to be ‘successful.’ 

When you look more closely at the music category’s profile, the sub-category performances are stark. Rock, Metal and Indie Rock bands need to make sure they have campaigns on Kickstarter. 95% of campaigns in those respective subcategories are successful and right now, there are no live campaigns within those categories. On the other end of the spectrum, Jazz and Faith campaigns nearly account for all the music category’s failures.

Campaigns that fall outside the theater, music and “film & video” parent categories all had campaigns that failed more often than were “successful” and have generally struggled to gain traction in the Kickstarter forum. Notable campaigns that seemed doomed to fail based on available data include ‘animation,’ ‘food trucks,’ and video games.”
